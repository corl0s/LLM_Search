# üîç Web-Augmented AI Assistant

This project is an **LLM-powered AI assistant** enhanced with **live web search capabilities**. It automatically determines whether a user query requires real-time data, performs web search using DuckDuckGo, extracts relevant content from search results, and uses it to generate accurate and up-to-date responses.
